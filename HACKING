How to contribute
=================

Useful notes how to contribute to the project.

Before committing
-----------------
All source files need to be passed through `sugar-lint`_ command.
Follow sugar-lint home page instructions and especially
`"Lint files before committing"` section.

Send patches
------------
Create your patches using ``git format`` command and send them to all
maintainers from the :ref:`AUTHORS <AUTHORS>` file. The easiest way it just
using ``git send-email`` command. Patches might be CCed to
sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org to attract more people to review.

Gitorious forks
---------------
Another useful way to contribute, especially for big improvements, is creating
Gitorious forks and request them for merge to the trunk.
